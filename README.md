# AwesomeConfig

My personal config for Awesome Window Manager, version 3.4.15 May eventually even have a theme.

If you want to use this, go ahead. Understand however that this is a configuration I tinker with, that I use on a computer I tinker with. It is not meant for public distrobution. Some things, such as the menu, are hardcoded into the config, and WILL break if you aren't me and don't have my exact install. Garenteed. 

TO DO
1: Impliment dynamic tagging
2: Seperate menu from config
3: Build a theme
4: Update to version 3.5

Ongoing Work
- Menu Design
- Clean up
