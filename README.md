# AwesomeConfig
My personal config for the Awesome Window Manager. May eventually even have a theme.

If you want to use this, go ahead. Understand however that this is configuration I tinker with, that I use on a computer I tinker with. It is not meant for public distrobution. Some things, such as the menu, are hardcoded into the config, and WILL break if you aren't me and don't have my exact install.

TO DO
1: Impliment a battery widget
2: Impliment a internet widget
3: Impliment dynamic tagging
4: Seperate menu from config
5: Build a theme

Ongoing Work
- Menu Design
- Clean up
